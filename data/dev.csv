Interesting tech - we have a GraphQL API, full CI/CD setup, Kubernetes deployment in Azure, plenty of interesting stuff on the backend (Postgres, ElasticSearch, Redis, Swoole, etc.)\n4. Constant challenges - we've already done all the boring stuff, so it's mostly building interesting new features, or working on new integrations - for example, we're currently integrating Looker, working on a Twilio integration, building a mobile app, and lots more..\n5. Great team/culture - 40 hour weeks are what we do, we aggressively hire (and fire) to maintain a good, healthy culture, and we really care about our employees. Full benefits are provided, along with a stipend for home office equipment that you can spend on almost anything you want. We have a book sharing club, we pay for conferences, and it's just generally a chill, fun place to work.\n6. We are engaged in all kinds of great outside projects - for example, we're a partner in Microsoft Airband, which is bringing Internet access to millions of unserved people around the world.\nHere's what I need:\n1. A great backend developer. Sonar is built using PHP+Laravel, running on Swoole. Someone with a deep level of experience in PHP would be great but, to be honest, I'm happy to hire anyone that is extremely competent in backend development and doesn't have an issue writing PHP : )\n2. Someone who is extremely self motivated. We tend to err on the side of leaving people alone to get work done, and since we're fully remote, that means you need to be really motivated and capable of working by yourself. For some people, this is pretty tough. If it sounds like a dream to you, you're good.\n3. Someone who has a high level of experience and good breadth of knowledge. We are always building challenging stuff, and we have significant complexity in the platform. We have to think about things like PCI compliance, security, SLA maintenance, and more - and it's a constant battle. Someone in this role needs to be able to think about the big picture, and understand how things interconnect. You should have the kind of mind that is always thinking about security and performance when writing code.\nYou should have a clear idea of what makes a good backend developer - you should enjoy writing tests, you should enjoy researching the best solution to a problem, and you should have a good understanding of the current technical landscape. There isn't really any devops in this position, but you should understand things like Kubernetes/containerization, when relational databases beat NoSQL, or why someone would use ElasticSearch, Hadoop, or Snowflake, for example.\nPay for this position is commensurate with experience.\nHere are the hard requirements - I just delete applications that ignore these : )\n1. No agencies/contract work/etc. I'm looking for individual, full time employees.\n2. Only hiring in the USA or Canada - no exceptions.\n3. Please make it clear in your resume how you meet the technical requirements listed - I always get a ton of applications, and lots of them are people that really aren't qualified. Help me help you - call out that you've read what I'm looking for, and speak to how you are a good fit.\nFeel free to reach out with any questions as well.\nJob Types: Full-time, Permanent\nSalary: $100,000.00-$150,000.00 per year\nJob Type: Full-time\nSalary: $100,000.00-$150,000.00 per year\nAdditional pay:\nBonus pay\nBenefits:\nDental care\nEmployee assistance program\nExtended health care\nVision care\nWork from home\nSchedule:\nMonday to Friday\nWork remotely:\nYes",https://ca.indeed.com/jobs?q=software%20developer&l=Toronto&start=40&vjk=13a019221351f72d&advn=5207738823621046
